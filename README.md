# dart-package-inspector

This action inspects your Dart/Flutter packages for a certain criteria based on the report  produced by the [pana](https://pub.dev/packages/pana), a package analyzer that is used on the pub.dev to compute Pub points.

Here's examples of what you can verify with this action:

- The package earns a total of 140 Pub points.
- The package earns at least 40 Pub points in the "Pass static analysis" category.
- The package scores 100% in the "Support up-to-date dependencies" category.
- The package supports the all platforms.
- The package is dart3 compatible.

## Usage

This action is intended to be used as a post-processor of  [dart-package-analyzer](https://github.com/axel-op/dart-package-analyzer.git), a well known GitHub Action that runs pana in the workflows. dart-package-inspector will use the output of this action as one of its inputs.

```yaml

      - uses: axel-op/dart-package-analyzer@v3 # Run pana on your package
        id: analysis # Set an ID to reference the outputs in the next step
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - uses: fujidaiti/dart-package-inspector@v1.0.0
        with:
